Star DAO Project Island â€“ Deployment Engine Core Mechanism (Draft)
This document is a preparatory outline for the core system diagram of the Star DAO Deployment Island. Based on previous statements by the founder, it will be used to create a visual representation.

1. Overall Objective
To build an open platform driven by modular smart contracts, automated deployment services, and a fair reward-sharing system.
The system allows anyone to submit code, images, or ideas, and in return receive automated deployment services, feedback, and DAO-based governance support.

2. Main Flow Structure
2.1 User Submission Process

Submit core files (e.g., .py, images, documents, concepts)

Optional assisted file generation (may require fees)

Simulated deployment (paid; supports trial & error)

Official deployment (tiered pricing by duration)

Results and feedback returned to user

2.2 Modular Division of Labor

All actions (deployment, verification, optimization) are handled via modules

Modules include:

Platform-built modules (native services)

User-contributed modules (plug-ins/extensions)

Revenue is split based on module usage:

Native module income goes to the platform

Contributed module income goes to its creator(s)

3. Pricing & Revenue Distribution
3.1 Points-Based Pricing

$1 = 10,000 points

Simulated Deployment: ~100 points (subject to adjustment)

Official Deployment:

2 mins = 200 pts

10 mins = 500 pts

30 mins = 1000 pts

Points and fiat/currency are interchangeable

3.2 Profit Distribution (After Server and Basic Costs)

5% to Main Island

5% to Project Island Leader

10% to Project Development Fund

40% to Governance, Module & Platform contributors

40% to Capital Investors (if investment exists)

Note:
This framework can be expanded into smart contract deployments, blockchain experiments, and more. Its modular design ensures scalability across technical categories.
